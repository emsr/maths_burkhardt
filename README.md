This is a slightly repackaged version of the collection of math special functions
collected and maintained by John Burkhardt.

This collection is not complete.  It concentrates on the special math functions.
Matrix routines and simulators and such are not exposed here.

I basically packaged things a a library with a header and one shared library.
I changed to cmake.

I had to try the wayback machine!
